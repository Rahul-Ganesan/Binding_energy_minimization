# Binding energy minimization using StD-CnG


Minimization of free energy of a molecule is highly significant in the field of Molecular mechanics which is the foundation of computational biology. For any molecule, free energy refers to the amount of energy needed for separating an individual particle from a system of particles or to disseminate all particles present in a system. The significance of free energy is that it can be used to compute the lowest energy conformation, which corresponds to the least Steric energy. The value of this free energy mainly depends upon various bond parameters like bond length, bond angle, and torsional angle. For finding the minimum value of this free energy there are various types of algorithms including Jacobi's method, Gauss-Seidel method, and Monte Carlo's algorithm could be used for computation, out of which iterative methods prove to be better in terms of accuracy though they are slower at times. Hence, this paper aims at computing the minimum value of binding free energy of various organic molecules in isolated conditions using the steepest descent algorithm and conjugate gradient algorithm and comparing them.
